# Find Your Hat Game

### Introduction

This is an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and he must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or leaving outside of the field.

 ## Why?
 
 I wanted to practice what I learned about JavaScript Classes and challenge myself.
 
 ## How To Use
 
 You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.
 
 ```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/AlessandraMorita/Find_Your_Hat

# Go into the repository
$ cd Find_Your_Hat

# Install prompt-sync
$ npm install prompt-sync 

# Run the app
$ npm run

# Run the app
$ node main.js
```

A field consists of a grid containing “holes” (O), one “hat” (^) and (░) indicate the rest of the field itself. You'll begin in the upper-left of the field, and your path is represented by *. Indicate which direction you’d like to “move” and press enter. 

Let's find your hat without falling down one of the holes :)

## Technologies

* JavaScript

## Project status 

The project is still being developed. Next challenges:

* Have the character start on a random location that’s not the upper-left corner.
* Create a “hard mode” where one or more holes are added after certain turns.
* Create a field validator to ensure that the field generated by Field.generateField() can actually be solved.
